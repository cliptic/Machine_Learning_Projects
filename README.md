Udacity Machine Learning Course with Enron Data.

# Machine Learning projects

---------------------------

## Data manipulation
- [train-test splitting]()
- randomising data selection
- Outlier management: selection and removal
- Feature scaling: Min/max scaling, Meanscaling, Z-score scaling
- [Feature selection](https://github.com/cliptic/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/master/feature_selection/find_signature.py)
- [PCA](https://github.com/cliptic/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/master/pca/eigenfaces.py): principal component analysis and eigenfaces
- ICA: independent component analysis
- Cross-training

## Supervised learning
## Naive Bayes 
- [Setting a classifier that sets apart letters by authors.](https://github.com/cliptic/Machine_Learning_Projects/tree/master/naive_bayes) 
### [Support Vector Machine SVC classifier](https://github.com/cliptic/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/master/svm/svm_author_id.py) 
- Using SVM SVC scassifier with different 
- C values 
- gamma values
- kernels
### [Decision Tree Classifier](https://github.com/cliptic/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/master/decision_tree/dt_author_id.py):
- Setting decision tree classifier and playing with features (min_samples_split, number of features, etc. )
- Understanding the concept and calculations of entropy
- BIAS vs VARIANCE
### K nearest neighbor
### [Random forest](https://github.com/cliptic/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/master/choose_your_own/your_algorithm.py)
### [Adaboots](https://github.com/cliptic/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/master/choose_your_own/your_algorithm.py)
### [Regressions](https://github.com/cliptic/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/master/regression/finance_regression.py)
- Linear regression
- Score data
- R_squared
- Predictions
## [Text learning](https://github.com/cliptic/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/master/text_learning/vectorize_text.py):
- Vectorizing with TFIDF
- Text management
- Classification (Bag of words)
- Stemming
- NLTK basics
## Unsupervised learning 
### [K-Means clustering](https://github.com/cliptic/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/master/k_means/k_means_cluster.py)
- Evaluation

--------------------------

The projects are taken form a Machine Learning course from Udacity.
Project base was set with for Python 2, the datasets and code manipulations are set to be adjusted for python 3. 
Adjustments include:
Setting /n for unix programming
Setting print() as command instead of a keyword by rewriting the code in different files
Changing cPickle and pickle packaging for Python 3*
