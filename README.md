Machine Learning projects
==============

The projects are taken form a MAchine Learning course from Udacity.
Project base was set with for Python 2, the datasets and code manipulations are set to be adjusted for python 3. 
Adjustments include:
- Setting /n for unix programming
- Setting print() as command instead of a keyword by rewriting the code in different files
- Changing cPickle and pickle packaging for Python 3

---------------------------

Supervised learning
- Naive Bayes: 
	Setting a classifier that sets apart letters by authors. 
- Support Vector Machine SVC classifier: 
	Using SVM SVC scassifier with different C, gamma values, kernels.
- Decision Tree Classifier:
	-- Setting decision tree classifier and playing with features (min_samples_split, number of features, etc. )
	-- Understanding the concept and calculations of entropy
	-- BIAS vs VARIANCE
- K nearest negihbour
- Random forest
- Adaboots
