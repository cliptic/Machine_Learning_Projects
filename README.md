# Machine Learning projects

---------------------------

## Data manipulation
- train-test splitting
- randomising data selection
- Outlier management: selection and removal
- Feature scaling: Min/max scaling
- Feature selections
- PCA: principal component analysis
- ICA: independent component analysis

## Supervised learning
[Naive Bayes](https://github.com/cliptic/Machine_Learning_Projects/tree/master/naive_bayes): 
- Setting a classifier that sets apart letters by authors. 
### Support Vector Machine SVC classifier: 
- Using SVM SVC scassifier with different C, gamma values, kernels.
### Decision Tree Classifier:
- Setting decision tree classifier and playing with features (min_samples_split, number of features, etc. )
- Understanding the concept and calculations of entropy
- BIAS vs VARIANCE
### K nearest neighbor
### Random forest
### Adaboots
### Regressions
- Score data
- R_squared
- Predictions
### Text learning:
- Vectorizing
- Text management
- Classification (Bag of words)
- Stemming
- Weighing
- NLTK
### Unsupervised learning: 
- K-Means clustering

#Valuations metrics
- Training score
- Testing score
- R^2

--------------------------

* The projects are taken form a Machine Learning course from Udacity.
Project base was set with for Python 2, the datasets and code manipulations are set to be adjusted for python 3. 
Adjustments include:
- Setting /n for unix programming
- Setting print() as command instead of a keyword by rewriting the code in different files
- Changing cPickle and pickle packaging for Python 3*
